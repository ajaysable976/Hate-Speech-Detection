# Hate-Speech-Detection
Hate speech is one of the serious issues we see on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, mostly from people with political views.

# Hate Speech Detection using Python
The dataset Iâ€™m using for the hate speech detection task is downloaded from Kaggle. This dataset was originally collected from Twitter and contains the following columns:

- index
- count
-hate_speech
- offensive_language
- neither 
- class
- tweet

# End-to-End Hate Speech Detection with Python
To deploy this model as an end-to-end application, I will be using the streamlit library in Python which will help us see the predictions of the hate speech detection
model in real-time. If you have never used the streamlit library before, you need to install it on your system using the pip command:
- pip install streamlit

# Summary
So, this is how you can easily build an end-to-end application to detect hate speech using the Python programming language. 
Hate speech is one of the serious issues we see on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, mostly from people with political views.
